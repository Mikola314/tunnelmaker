Features
--------
- Version 2.0 of tunnelmaker requires Minetest 5.0+.
- Create paths, bridges, and tunnels in all sixteen possible advtrains track directions with one click.
- Also digs up or down in the eight possible advtrains slope track directions.
- Digging mode and options can be set using new User Options menu.
- Supports Advanced trains mod with gravel embankment, arched and optionally lined tunnels, and two widths of bridges.
- Supports Bike mod with two widths of cobblestone pathways and bridges, along with unlined tunnels.
- Supports general excavation with unlined and lined tunnels.
- Adds reference nodes to help digging and laying advtrains track—now easy to remove when done.
- Adds glass enclosure when in water to create water tunnels.
- Requires "tunneling" privilege, and checks protections before digging.
- No crafting recipe, so needs to be given to player.
- Works in both creative and survival modes, but tunneling does not place any nodes into user's inventory.

Controls
--------
- **Left-click:** Super dig one node. One click digs any node (non-repeating) and places it in player's inventory. However, it can't be used to pick up dropped items.
- **Shift-left-click:** Bring up User Options menu (see below). Can also use Aux-right-click, which is needed for Android.
- **Right-click:** Dig tunnel in direction player pointed. Note that this won't place any of the dug nodes in player's inventory.
- **Shift-right-click:** Cycle through vertical digging modes, up, down, and horizontal.

How to enable
-------------
- Install tunnelmaker mod, requires default and stairs. For much smoother bike path ramps, I recommend that the angledstairs mod also be installed, but it's not required.
- Grant player "tunneling" privilege (/grant &lt;player&gt; tunneling).
- To give player a tunnelmaker tool use (/give &lt;player&gt; tunnelmaker:tool1).

How to dig
----------
*See diagram below that shows track configurations supported by advtrains.*

- Move to digging location and highlight node at ground level. (Gray node in diagrams marked with an '×'.)
- Point player in desired digging direction. (Inventory icon will change to show current direction.)
- Right-click mouse to dig tunnel.


Digging for slopes
------------------
*Note that advtrains only supports sloped track for orthogonal and diagonal track directions.*

- Move to digging location and highlight node at ground level.
- Point player in desired digging direction.
- Hold sneak key (shift on pc) and right-click mouse to select digging mode.  Inventory icon will cycle through possible modes with each click:  'U' for digging up, 'D' for digging down, and no letter for default horizontal.
- Release sneak key and right-click mouse to dig tunnel.
- User option whether to reset each time or not.

User Options menu
----------------
Use shift-left-click to bring up this menu.

Descriptions of all the options:

- **Digging mode** Select one of the three digging mode.
- **Wide paths / lined tunnels** Select between narrow and wide paths, and whether tunnels are lined with stone or not.
- **Continuous up/down digging** Don't reset up/down after each dig.
- **Clear tree cover** Remove all plant material above dig up to 30 nodes above ground. CPU intensive, so shuts off after two minutes.
- **Remove reference nodes** Easily remove reference nodes by walking over them. Also shuts off after two minutes.
- **Lock desert mode to: either "Desert" or "Non-desert"** Option only available when "add_desert_material = true" has been added to minetest.conf. Overrides use of desert materials in desert biomes. Useful for transition regions.

Advtrains digging reference
---------------------------
The following diagrams show how to make curved tunnels that support the different track configurations used by advtrains. There are three basic directions that are supported: 0° (orthogonal, rook moves), 45° (diagonal, bishop moves), and 26.6° (knight moves, two blocks forward and one block to the side).

- *Note that it's always possible to dig in any direction, but turns with angles other than those shown won't be supported by advtrains track.*
- *Also note that there are other limitations to advtrains slope track.  Documentation TBD.*
